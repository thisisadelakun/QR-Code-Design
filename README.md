## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties


### What I learned

I learned that when styling the div elements with class name you do not need to add the name of the element for example 


```css
main .card {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
this won't allow some styling to work, in line 28 of my style.css

### Continued development

I will like to focus more in my development both in frontend and backend. Working more in frontend in areas of css and making my work responsive across all devices

### Useful resources

- [Placing item in cenre](https://www.w3.org/Style/Examples/007/center.en.tmpl) - This helped me when i was trying to place my card in the centre and will use it going forward.
